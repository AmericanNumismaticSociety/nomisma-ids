 <div property="skos:definition">The most common usage is for the main silver coin of the Roman Republic and Empire. The term continued to be used in late imperial accounting and for subsequent coins. Nomisma does not exclude these uses of the term in context where these other senses are intended, though it may develop a more specific vocabulary in the future.</div>
