    Sheridan, ANSMN 18 (1972), pp. 5-15, illus.
    Thirty of the Chicago coins were seen in 
        trade in London together with the 
        Rhodian triob., all represented as 
        coming from the same hd. The find-
        spot was given as Mylasa, but this was 
        mere hearsay, perhaps influenced by 
        the composition. Details on these coins 
        are on file in BM and ANS
