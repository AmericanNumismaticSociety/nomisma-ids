    The BCH report mentions a hoard of 12 (?) 
        AV dr. found on Thasos: from which 
        Athens acquired. one piece. Another 
        8 AV dr., at Thessalonica, are said to 
        have been found in the 1960's at 
        Stryme. The BM has casts of additional 
        dr. appearing on the market at about 
        the same time. Some of the pieces are 
        of doubtful authenticity. It seems 
        likely that all of the material pertains 
        to the same find but the number of 
        genuine coins, as well as the date and 
        place of discovery, cannot be estab-
        lished
